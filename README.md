# Cadence_Feedback
All major files for Cadence Feedback thesis. Including both Arduino for real-time implementation and MATLAB for post processing. Have not used github before so excuse the bad structure, just wanted to place the completed code here.

# MATLAB
All MATLAB code is included, but most of it is testing that was completed. The test files are interesting and all included under the TESTING_RESULTS files. The SIMULINK files are also included and essential to the project. All other MATLAB files are not very valuable and mostly dealt with reading in data from other sources and double checking calculations for the control system.

# Arduino
Only one arduino file, HR_and_SPM_v2 which is the file loaded on the Arduino and what is used in real time. It is heavily commented for understanding. Uses an FSM for real time processing and simple signal processing techniques.
